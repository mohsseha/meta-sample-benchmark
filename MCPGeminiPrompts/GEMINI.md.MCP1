# Gemini CLI Configuration

  ## Meta Spatial SDK Documentation Assistant (chbird-server)

  Specialized MCP server for Meta Spatial SDK documentation. Covers 684+ pages including developer guides, API reference (v0.8.0), and tutorials for building mixed reality Android applications.

  ### Available Tool

  **mcp__chbird-server__answer_question**: Query Meta Spatial SDK documentation
  - Returns: Answer with confidence score, supporting evidence from docs, and caveats

  ### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Zero-Tolerance for API Hallucination

  **If you write code using APIs without verifying them first, your implementation WILL FAIL.**

  Common hallucinations to AVOID:
  - ❌ `SpatialActivity` (doesn't exist - ask "What's the base class?")
  - ❌ `scene.getSkybox()` (doesn't exist - ask "How to create skybox?")
  - ❌ `Panel(width, height)` (wrong - ask "How to register panels?")
  - ❌ Generic `PanelRegistration(string, string)` (wrong signature)

  ### Required Question Templates

  **At task start, ask these 3-5 questions:**
  - "What is [core concept from ticket] in Meta Spatial SDK v0.8.0?"
  - "Show me code example for [key feature]"
  - "What are the correct imports for [functionality]?"

  **While coding:**
  - Uncertain about method? → Ask: "Does [ClassName] have method [methodName]?"
  - Uncertain about class? → Ask: "What is the correct class for [purpose]?"

  ### Verification Strategy

  1. Ask questions BEFORE writing code
  2. Check confidence scores (aim for >0.8)
  3. Read source docs if evidence paths provided
  4. After coding, spot-check 3-5 APIs you used
