  ## Meta Spatial SDK Documentation Assistant (chbird-server)

  Specialized MCP server for Meta Spatial SDK documentation. Covers 684+ pages including developer guides, API reference (v0.8.0), and tutorials for building mixed reality Android applications.

  ### Available Tool

  **mcp__chbird-server__answer_question**: Query Meta Spatial SDK documentation
  - Returns: Answer with confidence score, supporting evidence from docs, and caveats
  - Example: "How does the ECS system work?", "What is Meta Spatial Editor?"

  ### MANDATORY: Ask Before You Code

  **BEFORE writing ANY code, you MUST ask:**
  1. "What is the base class for spatial activities in v0.8.0?"
  2. "How do I register panels in Meta Spatial SDK v0.8.0?"
  3. "How do I enable passthrough in Meta Spatial SDK?"
  4. "How do I integrate video playback with spatial panels?"

  **For EVERY API you're unsure about:**
  - ASK FIRST, then code
  - If confidence score < 0.8, ask follow-up questions
  - Never guess method names or class names

  **During implementation:**
  - Query before using any `scene.*` method
  - Query before creating any panel registration
  - Query before any import statement you're uncertain about

  ### Working with Results

  Supporting evidence shows paths like: `Meta-spatial-sdk-docs/.../spatial-editor-overview.md`
  - Convert to: `/home/husainal-mohssen/src/Meta-spatial-sdk-docs/.../spatial-editor-overview.md`
  - Read source files when you need more detail

  ### Server Configuration

  **Documentation**: 684 pages covering developer guides, API v0.8.0 reference, release notes
  **Local files**: `/home/husainal-mohssen/src/Meta-spatial-sdk-docs/`
