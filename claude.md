# Claude Communication Guidelines for This Project

## Tone & Style
- **Be concise**: Keep responses short (1-4 lines typically) unless complexity requires more detail
- **No preamble/postamble**: Skip "Here is...", "Based on...", "I will now..."
- **Direct answers**: Answer questions immediately without unnecessary context
- **Match verbosity to task**: Simple questions get simple answers, complex tasks get appropriate detail
- **Professional & objective**: Focus on facts, not validation or praise

## User's Communication Style
- User writes quickly with typos - understand intent, don't nitpick spelling
- User prefers iterative discussion before implementation
- User values asking questions to clarify before diving in

## When to Use Tools
- Use TodoWrite for multi-step or complex tasks
- Research URLs provided before making assumptions
- Read files before editing them
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear

## This Project's Focus
- Creating a benchmark comparing AI agents with/without ChBird.ai
- Target audience: Meta, to demonstrate value for their Spatial SDK development
- Success metric: Prove agents + ChBird produce better code than agents alone
- Deliverable: Polished markdown document making the business case
