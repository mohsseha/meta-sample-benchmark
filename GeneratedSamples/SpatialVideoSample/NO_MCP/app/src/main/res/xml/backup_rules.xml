   In this file you can specify which parts of your application's data you want to be backed up.
   Android's backup service backs up and restores the data of apps installed on a device.
   This file is used to configure which files are backed up.
   By default, the service backs up almost all app data.
   You can use this file to include or exclude specific files or directories.
   For more information, see the Android documentation on Auto Backup for Apps:
