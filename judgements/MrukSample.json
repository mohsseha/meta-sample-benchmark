While its entire implementation is based on a hallucinated version of the SDK, this is still far more useful than NO_MCP's submission, which consists almost entirely of empty placeholder files. NO_MCP failed to implement four of the five requirements, providing no logic whatsoever for the core MRUK features. A developer could theoretically correct MCP's code by replacing the fake API calls, whereas NO_MCP's code provides no starting point for development beyond a file name."
