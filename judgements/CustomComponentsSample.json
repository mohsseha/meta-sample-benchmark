It correctly identifies the need to register both the component and the system in the activity, and it correctly uses the `AppSystemActivity` base class, even if the package is wrong. NO_MCP's submission hallucinates a different, incorrect base activity (`SpatialActivity`) and fails to register the custom component entirely. Although both failed on API correctness, MCP's attempt demonstrates a slightly better understanding of the required application structure and setup process, making it the marginally better starting point."
