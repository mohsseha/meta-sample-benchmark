It correctly identifies the need for an `AppSystemActivity` and the registration of systems, which is a core concept of the SDK. NO_MCP, on the other hand, fails at this fundamental level, opting for a standard Android `ComponentActivity` and hallucinating a `SpatialApp` composable that completely misrepresents how the SDK works. While both implementations failed to correctly implement most features, MCP's attempt was closer to the correct architecture, making it the slightly better starting point despite its own significant errors."
