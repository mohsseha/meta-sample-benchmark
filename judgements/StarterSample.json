NO_MCP, in contrast, hallucinates the entire SDK architecture, inventing a `Connection` object, multiple non-existent features, and a completely fictional composable-based panel system. MCP's errors are incorrect API calls within a somewhat correct structure, while NO_MCP's errors are a fundamentally wrong architecture from the ground up, making its code unsalvageable."
