MCP correctly identified that a specialized activity, `AppSystemActivity`, is required for immersive mode, even though it used the wrong package name. This shows a slightly deeper, albeit flawed, understanding of the SDK's architecture. In contrast, the NO_MCP agent used a standard `ComponentActivity` and invented a completely fictional API (`SpatialActivity.createIntent`) to handle immersive mode, which is a more fundamental architectural error. MCP's total score was 7, while NO_MCP's was 6. Given the severity of NO_MCP's architectural hallucinations, MCP has a slightly higher probability of being on a more correct path."
