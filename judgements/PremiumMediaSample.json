  "MCPWinProbability": 0.6,
  "MCPWinReasoning": "MCP wins, though narrowly. Both implementations failed to use the correct Meta Spatial SDK v0.8.0 APIs for key features like MRUK, panel registration, and shaders, often hallucinating entire packages and classes. However, MCP's core architectural choice was better; it correctly identified `AppSystemActivity` as the base class, even with a wrong package, whereas NO_MCP used a completely fictional `SpatialActivity`. Furthermore, MCP's separation of UI and player activities, while not the multi-process architecture required, is a more robust pattern than NO_MCP's single-activity approach. NO_MCP's implementation of features like MRUK and shaders was more complete, but it was built entirely on a foundation of hallucinated APIs, making it fundamentally non-functional. MCP's mistakes are slightly closer to the correct SDK structure, giving it a marginal edge."
