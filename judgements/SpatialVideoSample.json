  "MCPWinProbability": 0.7,
  "MCPWinReasoning": "MCP is moderately better than NO_MCP, primarily because its foundational architecture is closer to the reference implementation. MCP correctly identifies the need for `AppSystemActivity` and a custom `ISystem` (`SceneManager`), and it attempts to use concepts like `Panel` and `SpatialAudioSystem`, even though its implementation of them is heavily flawed with hallucinated APIs (e.g., `com.meta.spatial.sdk.*` package, `SpatialSound` component). NO_MCP's foundation is completely incorrect, starting with `AppCompatActivity` and inventing a fictional `com.meta.xr.sdk` that bears no resemblance to the actual Meta Spatial SDK v0.8.0. While both failed to implement key features and relied on fictional APIs, MCP's hallucinations were incorrect applications of real SDK concepts, whereas NO_MCP's were a complete departure from the correct architecture. Therefore, MCP's attempt is a more salvageable starting point."
