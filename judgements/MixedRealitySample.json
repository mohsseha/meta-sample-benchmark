However, MCP wins slightly because its architectural guess was closer to the ground truth. MCP correctly identified `AppSystemActivity` as the base class and understood the concept of registering systems, even though its API calls were wrong. NO_MCP chose a completely incorrect base class (`SpatialActivity`) and used a different, inaccurate lifecycle model. While both were non-functional, MCP's hallucinations were built on a more accurate foundational structure, making it marginally better."
