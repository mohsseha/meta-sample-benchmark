  "MCPWinReasoning": "MCP is substantially better because its implementation, while flawed, is grounded in the correct foundational class of the Meta Spatial SDK. It correctly uses `AppSystemActivity` as the base for `MainActivity`, which is the essential entry point for any spatial application. Its hallucinations, such as `PanelSystem`, are incorrect APIs but exist within a conceptually plausible structure. In contrast, NO_MCP fails at the most fundamental level by using a standard `ComponentActivity` and inventing an entire, non-existent SDK structure (`com.meta.spatial.sdk.base.Sdk`). While NO_MCP's isolated video player composable is well-written, the complete failure to integrate with the actual SDK makes its entire approach unworkable. MCP's code provides a much more viable starting point for a developer to fix."
