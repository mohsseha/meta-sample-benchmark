However, MCP is the clear winner because it successfully produced the single most critical file for an Android application: the MainActivity. Although its implementation is deeply flawed, it at least provides a valid entry point and correctly identifies the AppSystemActivity base class and the systemManager.registerSystem method. NO_MCP failed to generate an activity at all, making its submission completely unusable and structurally incomplete from the start. The presence of a valid, albeit flawed, activity structure gives MCP a significant advantage."
