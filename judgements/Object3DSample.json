However, MCP's attempt is slightly better because it correctly identified the 'AppSystemActivity' as the base class, which is a more fundamental aspect of the SDK's architecture than the other parts. NO_MCP started with a hallucinated base class ('ImmersiveActivity'), which shows a greater deviation from the correct SDK patterns. While both failed on the details, MCP's initial architectural choice was closer to the reference implementation, giving it a slight edge."
